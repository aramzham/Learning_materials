## Description  
Terruño Nayarita provides ultimate traceability into the lots—each bag is uniquely identified with a barcode and serial number that reveals everything behind its production. Gathered around an extinct volcano, Cerro San Juan, a committed group of 260 cooperative coffee farmers are working together to produce arguably the best coffee in Mexico.

Terruño Nayarita coffees come from heirloom trees. The word ‘Terruño’ means ‘homestead’. These are farmers who take great pride in their coffee. This is the top screen-size/grade from the Terruño Nayarita Co-op.

## Tasting Notes  
Always one of our favorite Mexican coffees. Good from light to dark. Although natural processed, this is not a fruit bomb like many other naturals—it has slightly fruity overtones that balance well with citric, malt, and nutty undertones. A little fuller bodied than most Terruño lots with above-average sweetness.

- **Light roasts:** Noticeable citric crispness upfront, accentuates fruitiness and citric notes with a touch of herbal.  
- **Medium roasts:** Balanced tones, smooth out the citric brightness.  
- **Dark roasts:** More chocolaty, roasty, and smoky. Retains a sweet edge and shows hints of fruitiness as the cup cools.

A good daily drinker across roast levels.

## Roasting Notes  
A nice medium roast is the way to go, but you can lean lighter or darker depending on personal taste. Roasts pretty evenly for a natural, though you’ll see a couple outliers. It’s a bit higher chaff, but still in the easier-to-roast category.
