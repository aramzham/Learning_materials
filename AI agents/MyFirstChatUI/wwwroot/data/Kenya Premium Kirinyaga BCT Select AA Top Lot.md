## Description  
In 2024 I finally put feet on the ground in Kenya and I finally understood what makes Kirinyaga (and Kenya as a whole) coffee so special. Much of Kenyan coffee is produced in more arid regions. As you get a little farther away from Mt Kenya, the climate dries up quickly. Kirinyaga is one of the most lush environments in Kenya, quite jungle-like and as many know, good rainfall and plenty of shade often makes the tastiest cup.

Growing the coffee is only half the battle to producing stellar coffee. What separates Kenya from most other producing nations is the way it organizes farmers into Farmer Cooperative Societies (FCS). Basically every farmer, large or small, is connected to internal infrastructure that gives them the support, knowledge and tools to grow the best coffee. These FCS’s are all locally owned, organized and run, letting them adapt to their microclimates and individual needs.

The last part, and equally as important but a little highly debated if good or bad, is the final step in coffee production—the dry milling and auction system. Almost all Kenya coffees funnel through three processors, only one being owned by the Kenyans themselves. The good behind this: Kenya dry mills have some of the most impressive technology and facilities to produce absolutely stellar lots. In my travels I have never seen processing centers like they have in Kenya. One never sees bad export lots—basically every lot is a gem.

The bad: they are mostly foreign controlled and the FCS’s must use one of the three to end up with a final product. There are good laws in place to protect the farmers, but they have very little choice on how to finalize the processing and export the coffee.

## Tasting Notes  
A very clean and bright cup, silky-smooth mouthfeel that shines from the first whiff of honey sweetness to the final sip of bolder spice. Best served at light-to-medium roasts.

A brighter, full-flavored cup with great depth of flavor. Upon first sip, one will see a vibrant burst of lemon/orange citric comingling with a slight red fruit, quickly balanced by a creamy cocoa undertone with a little gentle black-tea-like spice in the aftertaste. Underlying notes of roasted nuts and cocoa anchor the profile.

As the cup cools the acidity softens and a deeper chocolate note swells, yet the honey aromatics persist, making every temperature stage deliciously consistent.

## Roasting Notes  
An easy-going bean with moderate chaff and even color. Keep it in the light-to-medium range if you’re after the fresh citrus pop and fruity nuance; these roasts showcase the red-lemon snap, blueberry sweetness, and honey fragrance while preserving a lighter, tea-like body.

Taken to Full City, just shy of second crack, the fruit folds gracefully into rich cocoa and roasted-nut depth, yielding a silky medium body and mellow orange acidity.

Pushed into second crack for espresso or cold-brew fans, you’ll land a cup of smooth bittersweet chocolate with low acidity and a subtle spicy edge.

Let the coffee rest 48–72 hours after roasting: the citrus settles, the honey rounds out, and the cup shows its full character.
