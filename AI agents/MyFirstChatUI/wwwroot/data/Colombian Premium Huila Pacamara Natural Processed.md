## Description  
This natural-processed, single-variety lot comes from a group of eight smallholder farmers in Huila, working in the districts of La Argentina, Acevedo, and Pitalito at elevations ranging from 1600 to 2000 masl.

This strain of Arabica originated in El Salvador as a cross between the Pacas and Maragogipe varieties. Pacamara is known for its high-cup quality and long and usually large, oval-shaped seeds. Generally the beans are huge, but in this case, they are average-sized beans—very small for a Pacamara.

Often the smaller beans are sweeter and less complex, but the producers made an excellent decision in pairing them with the slow dry natural processing.

## Tasting Notes  
Good from light to dark, but to see the fruit notes shine, keep it in the light to medium ballpark. A bit of lemony citrus upfront that fades into a sweet red fruit tone, followed by a bit of nutty/herbal darker notes. The sweetness and fruitiness linger on the tongue.

A longer setup helps rid the lighter roasts of the more herbal qualities. Medium roasts are pretty bulletproof and well balanced, showing a little more of a potent nutty/chocolate undertone but no missing the fruitiness and slight citric.

Darker roasts worked very nicely for a natural processed—sometimes they get all sour and twangy—but being both a Colombia and Pacamara, the more robust body and nuttiness of these beans, with a chocolate and smoky overtone, balance very well. Add on a little sweet fruitiness in the aftertaste and one has a winning dark roast natural.

## Roasting Notes  
An easy coffee to roast; hard to find a bad roast point. Due to higher chaff levels, slightly smaller bean screen, and two-toned roasting, nailing your roast on the first go can be a little challenging.

Coffee has a bit longer first crack due to the two-toned roasting. Make sure first crack has subsided pretty well before cooling or risk a little grassy flavor.

Getting a little development past first crack can be wise—erroring more towards a medium roast builds more body and reduces acidity, minimizing grassy or herbal notes from too light of a roast.

As you push towards a darker roast (strong medium), the surface will start to show a strong sheen—can help identify roast level.

A very nice, super clean Huila cup! Buttery textured and complex; strong semi-sweet traditional walnut/chocolate tones.
