## Description  
A very unique, overly fermented (very fruity) cup of joe. Bali is a tiny island—actually, a submerged volcano peak—just off the east coast of Java, with many small coffee farms.

The farmers who grow Kintamani Natural belong to cooperative organizations known as Subak Abian (SA), founded on a Hindu philosophy known as “Tri Hita Karana” (the three causes of happiness). SA co-ops foster community in agricultural, social, and religious activities, and have been certified Organic since 2008. Pesticides are never used on their coffee farms, and fertilizers are 100% organic.

SA farmers grow almost all heirloom Arabicas, Typica & Bourbon. They use trees such as Erythrina, Tangerine, and Orange to shade the coffee, which improves yield and cup quality and enhances wildlife habitat.

“Kintamani Natural” is 100% sundried on raised beds; it’s perhaps the first ever special prep natural Indonesian. Raised beds keep the cherry free of dirty flavor and facilitate very quick drying in Bali’s high altitude sun and constant island breeze.

The cup is extraordinarily exotic and unique with a rich, buttery mouthfeel, while retaining Indonesia’s full-bodied, savory character. It features super-intense, brandyish fruit flavors of plum and sweet cherry at lighter roasts; darker roasts develop much heavier body with a spicy, smoky twist.

An easy roaster that’s exceptionally versatile—roast Bali “Kintamani Natural” any way you’d like; slow or quick, from first crack to French, you’ll get very unique and terrific flavor!

## Tasting Notes  
Very fermenty/fruity, lower acidity cup with good body. A wild old-world natural processed coffee, good from light to dark.

A beautiful tasting bean this season: slightly fruitier but still balances with traditional Indonesian character. Hints of acidity with stronger fruitiness at lighter roasts, strong fruit/oak tones on a more nutty/earthy/chocolaty profile at darker roast points.

No missing the wild side in this cup. Medium roasts are where one should shoot for their first roast—mutes some nutty tones and pronounces the chocolaty factor for some balance, still plenty of wild fruity natural processed tones in the cup.

Dark roasts will introduce some smoky accents but retain great sweetness. A great balance of slow dried natural with thick and creamy dark tones all in one cup.

## Roasting Notes  
Higher chaff and slightly uneven roasting. Right around a full city roast (close or touching 2nd crack) is going to be the sweet spot for a bulletproof roast level.

Lighter can be quite tasty as well—much more emphasis on the fruitiness—but too light and one can get some sour/herbal. Most will want to push it more towards a medium roast or darker.

Right before 2nd crack mutes up a bit of fruit but gets more like a single origin Mokka Java blend or Yemen-type cup profile—a bit of rustic chocolate and a bit of fruit—almost anyone would like that cup!

Very exotic, fruity, smooth, low acidity and fuller bodied. This crop year is a little closer to its Indonesian roots with the full body.
