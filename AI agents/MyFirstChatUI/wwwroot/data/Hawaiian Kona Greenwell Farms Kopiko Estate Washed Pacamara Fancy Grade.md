## Description  
The Greenwell Farms legacy began in 1850 when Henry Nicholas Greenwell left England and first set foot on the fertile soil of rural Kona. Greenwell Farms is one of the biggest names in Kona coffee. This is their highest quality bean, a very large, clean, polished coffee with a flavor matching the looks.

Kopiko Estate is a recent addition to Greenwell and used as their model farm for many small holders. At a higher altitude than most, and contains experimental coffee strains used to advance both disease resistance and better tastes.

Good to have friends in high places! Greenwell always holds the best lots for us and this year it is a true honor. The crop has been horrible, both quantity and general quality are behind last year (which was also rough). Do not fear though, this offering is truly the needle in the haystack. Really one of the best lots we have found in years!

Could be one of the only Extra Fancy Kona micro-lots on the market this year and is one of our favorite strains, Pacamara! Sweet fruity/floral versus strong chocolate notes, a wonderful profile.

## Tasting Notes  
A very clean, well balanced cup; crisp acidity and soft fruit tones comingle with a more chocolaty finish. Can be roasted from light to dark.

The acidity is a bit citrus/floral upfront but will quickly fade into a rocking islandy fruit tone. From a medium roast on, the acidity is very gentle and balanced with a smooth to rough chocolaty cup profile—milk chocolate before 2nd crack, baker’s chocolate and smoky into 2nd crack.

Medium bodied, these beans—as well as other Kona’s—are mild cups comparatively to many other origins. Be in for a delicate and tasty cup with layers of goodness.

## Roasting Notes  
A gem of processing, even roasting with low-medium chaff levels. If shooting for lighter roasts, make sure at least 95% of beans are through first crack.

A quick light roast will be pretty bright and semi-herbal with strong fruit tones. Assuming you don’t mind some citric and fruit tones in the cup, it will be most exotic at the lighter roast points.

Medium roasts are gentle and sweet, a cup everyone will love. Darker roasts are tasty but way more neutral of a cup—a little bit of shame to burn out those cool island tones. Stronger and a bit fuller bodied.

Hawaii has had a troubled year—bad weather, volcanoes and hurricanes. The impact on many coffee lots from Kona can be seen this year.
