## Description  
A great super clean Decaf Brazil. Hard to tell this one is a decaf! This Brazil has a nutty and fruity aroma. Medium bodied with a dark chocolate and dryer nuttiness. A smooth, rich, clean cup perfect for those decaf espresso drinks.

Many use more neutral beans like this to create a house blend. Easily adopts anything blended into it. If looking for a half-calf, roast this one a bit darker and find a jazzy caffeinated to blend with it. We like Natural processed ferment/fruity coffees in smaller percentages to contrast the darker Brazil tones. Something like Ethiopian Natural processed would make a tasty treat.

During the MWP (Mountain Water Process), the green coffee is pre-soaked in water to expand the beans for caffeine extraction. The hydrated green coffee is then introduced to a unique solution of concentrated coffee solubles that draw out the caffeine while minimizing the loss of flavor compounds. Once the caffeine has been removed the green coffee is re-dried and re-bagged for transport, and the extract solution is filtered of its caffeine and recycled to be used again.

## Tasting Notes  
Great as a single origin Americana or Espresso, also works well in decaf espresso blends. Medium bodied, semi-sweet with fruitier aromatics and a dryer chocolaty/nutty undertone. Medium roasts are very smooth with a hint of sweetness, darker roasts are dryer with some smokiness.

## Roasting Notes  
I found this coffee best roasted to a full city, just before the second crack. It is versatile, could be taken lighter or darker depending on your preference. This Brazil has a very fruity wet aroma. Medium bodied with a dark chocolate nuttiness. A smooth, rich, clean cup perfect for those decaf espresso drinks.
