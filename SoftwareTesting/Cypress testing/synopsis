Before Cypress

- Framework (Mocha, Jasmine, Karma)
- Assertion Library (Chai, Expect.js)
- install Selenium
- Selenium wrapper (Protractor, Nightwatch)
- Other (Sinon, TestDouble)

Cypress contains them all in one testing framework.


visit, get, request, exec, route are parent command => they are the heads of command chain, they cannot be secondary commands

cy.get('something=username').click() , here click is a child command
click, type, find, should are child commands

contains, screenshot, scrollTo, wait are dual commands (both child and parent)

Cypress retries the last command in the chain before assertion => command, assertion, command assertion pattern will use the cypress retriability thoroughly
