The consumer of a GraphQL API defines the data structure it want to receive in a query.

GraphQL is an open source specification created by FB.

Not the verb of the request defines what happens but the query itself.

GraphQL is not tied to HTTP.


Schema - entry point for all queries.
Query - exposes data types.

{
    __schema{
        types{
            name
        }
    }
}

// get schema
{
    __type(name:"yourSchemaName"){
        name
        fields{
            name
            type{
                name
                kind
            }
        }
    }
}

// do not show docs and schema in playground
const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers, dataSources, introspection: false });

put playground: false  and you won't have the playground

set debug to false to hide stack traces from end user
